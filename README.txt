My partner hasn't responded to me, and shortly before the WIP deadline I got an email saying he had dropped the class. This is entirely my own work. 

I have only had the chance to fix Project 1 bugs; that means that no memory, branch, or jump operations have been implemented. The only bug that needed to be fixed was that ANDI, ORI, and XORI sign-extended rather than 0-extended the immediate. One logic gate and one multiplexor have been added to the decode stage.
